    <h1>My Family</h1>
    <h2>Dad</h2>
    <p>
      He is the head of the family. He is the breadwinner and in his free time,
      he enjoys watching facebook videos in the living room with a volume of
      150% (free time includes Sunday 6:00am). He is also a fitness enthusiast
    </p>
    <h2>Mom</h2>
    <p>
      She is a teacher by proffession. Best cook in the house by virtue of being
      the only female in the house. Don't be surprised if she asks you to turn
      on the tv only for her to use her phone instead of watching it. And don't
      you dare switch it off.
    </p>
    <h2>Brothers</h2>
    <p>
      They get to share a paragraph because they've been sharing everything
      since they were kids (they are twins). They've been in the same
      institutions since birth (literally). Born in the same hospital, went to
      the same kindergaten, same primary school, same secondary school. Oh and
      same University. How to tell them apart? Their hairline... or lack
      thereof.
    </p>
    <h2>Me</h2>
    <p>
      I don't know how to describe myself ðŸ˜‚. Male, 19 years of age, plays the
      guitar in his free time, passion for tech. I think that's all.
